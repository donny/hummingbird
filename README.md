# hummingbird

Hummingbird is a [Trello](https://trello.com) client for macOS written using [Swift](https://swift.org) 3 and [AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Swift](https://swift.org) 3, [AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit) (revisit), and [Trello API](https://developers.trello.com) (revisit).

I built a small Trello client for macOS in April last year using Swift 2 and AppKit. Simply because I much preferred native app experience over web experience and I wanted to learn more about AppKit. I didn't have the chance to learn and use Swift 3 and Hummingbird is a simple rewrite of the app using  the new version of Swift.
